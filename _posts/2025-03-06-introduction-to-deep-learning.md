Deep learning is currently one of the most booming technologies, playing a major role in the _"OpenAI's ChatGPT era"_. Although it is built upon the transformer architecture—proposed by Google developers in 2017—the roots of this architecture go back to the very fundamentals that have shaped deep learning into what it is today. In this blog, we're going to explore a few key concepts behind this revolutionary technology...

## Motivation

The main motivation of this blog is help both developers and people in general who are looking to learn a few things about Machine Learning and specifically Deep Learning. I want to demystify some of the common misconceptions that people take for granted without filtering out the facts from the overly hyped ___"AI"___ product within the current marketplace. Talking specifically about developers, this blogs helps them kick-start their journey into field deep learning and helps them understand a thing or two when they hear more advancements or attend an event.

When I was planning to write a blog on deep learning, I have no prior exposure to this domain. I do have some idea where to begin, but I got lost in numerous resources but most of them are not so clear on the prerequisites to understand their material. During that time, I got into one of scholarship for a GenAI course on Udacity platform offered by Bertelsmann. Taking this course helped me understand the core fundamental of deep learning within the first module. I spent quite some time understanding the core components of a simple deep learning model called "Multilayer Perceptron". I really thank Bertelsmann for sponsoring the GenAI Nano Degree program on Udacity platform, this course motivated me to share my learning thus supporting my initial cause to work on this blog.

Don't worry, this course is not the only resource from which I transpile the knowledge to you. I have my done my research and iterated over many parts of blog just to get thing right and more beginner-friendly.
